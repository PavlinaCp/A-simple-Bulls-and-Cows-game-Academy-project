# Bulls and Cows Game

A simple Python implementation of the classic **Bulls and Cows** game.

Description:
This program generates a random 4-digit number with unique digits (the first digit cannot be zero) and asks the player to guess it.  
After each guess, the program provides feedback in terms of:

- **Bulls** – correct digits in the correct positions  
- **Cows** – correct digits in the wrong positions  
The game also tracks the number of guesses and the total time taken.

Features:
- Validates user input (must be 4 unique digits, first digit not zero)  
- Gives clear feedback on bulls and cows  
- Tracks number of attempts and game duration  
- Provides a replay option after finishing the game
